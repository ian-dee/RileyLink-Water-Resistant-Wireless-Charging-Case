# RileyLink-Water-Resistant-Wireless-Charging-Case
Water Resistant Wireless Charging Case for the RileyLink

This repository is for Drawing & STL files used to make the production version of the W2 case found on GetRileyLink.org. This case will fit both Medtronic or Omnipod versions of the RileyLink1.0 Board. The only difference between these files and the production version, is the omission of the Barometric Vent hole in the open source version. This is because the Barometric Vent is not an off the shelf component, and would be impossible for a maker to source. The case will still work as intended without the hole, but the case will need to be "burped" of pressure as the top is being put on. 

There are 5 Rev C Files: 

1. PDF Drawing showing the exploded view of the case

2. 3 STL Files

3. Excel File BOM with purchase links to Wireless charging circuit, O-Rings, kapton tape, etc.
